To do list created with help of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
I made it during Coder's Lab bootcamp.

It's simple application with the following features:
- Your task should has minimum 6 letters but less than 100 letters
- Counter tells you how many tasks are left to be completed
- The "Delete" button deletes task whether it's completed or not
- The "Complete" button changes the color of task to pink
- "Remove finished tasks" removes the tasks which are marked as completed
